Linear regression is used to predict the profit of 50 startups. 
We use a dataset containing startup information such as R&D spend, administration spend, marketing spend, state and profit. 
We preprocess data, split into training and testing sets, and apply linear regression to the training data. 
We evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared, and fine-tune hyperparameters like regularization strength to improve the model.
We then use the final linear regression model to predict the profit of the 50 startups.
